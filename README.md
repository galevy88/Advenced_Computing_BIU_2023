# Advenced_Computing_BIU_2023

This GitHub Repo was crated for BIU Advenced Computing Course. 
Course number: 89210

This repo contains cpp code examples from the lectures and also additional examples in order to clarifying the concepts we just learned.

Each folder contain cpp/header files with a descriptions and more elaborated explanations about the code.

The main goal of this repo is to to get a quick access to the examples learned in the class and also the option to debug the code in order to understand it better.

Notice that some folders contain images of the memory representation while runing important part of the code And thus we can see how to memory was allocated.

The website I used to fetch the images is:

Here as an exapmle:

The main goal of this repo is to be source of true knowledge about what we learned in the course and of course feel free to update it and add your own explinations and examples.
